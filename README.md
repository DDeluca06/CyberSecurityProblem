# Problem: Hiring Experienced Cyber Security Analysts
The cybersecurity industry faces a persistent talent gap despite growing demand. According to Lightcast.io, the U.S. had over 1.5 million cybersecurity job openings in 2024, with only about 1.28 million workers available, leaving a gap of approximately 225,200 professionals. The demand spans multiple industries, with mid-level roles requiring 2-10 years of experience facing the highest shortages.

# Solution:
Taking early initiative and getting the new generation interested in Cyber Security by demonstrating to them the importance of these jobs and how they can help make their communities a better, more secure place for everyone.
